Recently, a survey [^1] comprehensivelly summarizes the existing graph processing frameworks. It reviews the techniques of the frameworks, but it lacks a popularity survey. Which is the most popular or influencial framework among all of them?. In this blog, I want to add more data on the popularity perspective of the existing graph processing frameworks.



## Popularity Definition

There are many kinds of definitions on popularity. In this survey, I mainly concern on **citation popularity**. The citation popularity of a graph processing framework is defined as the number of citations of the related paper on Google Scholar.

As the older papers tend to have more citations than the newer paper, I also provide the **normalized citation popularity**, i.e. dividing the number of citations by the age of the framework. The age of the framework is defined as the pasted years since the publication of the related paper. A framework published in 2018 has the age of 1.

## Results

I use the citation notation provided in [^1]. The following table is based on the Table 3 in [^1].

The data was collected on Dec. 11, 2018.
