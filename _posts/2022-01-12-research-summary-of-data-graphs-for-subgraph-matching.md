This blog summarizes the data graphs that are frequently used in **isomorphism-based subgraph matching** algorithm/system research. The surveyed literature is listed in the "Reference" section.


## Problem Definition of Isomorphism-based Subgraph Matching

Given a *single* large data graph $D$ and a small query graph $q$, the target of *subgraph isomorphism* is to find all subgraphs of $D$ that are isomorphic to $q$.

The data graph and query graph may have labels attached to the vertices and/or edges. In those cases, a subgraph of $D$ matches the query graph $q$ if and only if they are isomorphic and their corresponding vertex/edge labels match.

## Classification of Graph Datasets

The graph datasets that are used as data graphs in research can be grouped into two groups: real-world graphs and synthetic graphs.

### Real-world Graphs

The statistics and description of the real-world graph datasets are summarized in the following table. Each graph dataset is given a unified code name.

*Note: The statistics of each graph are retrieved from the literature. Their precision values depend on how to process the dataset files. Since different authors may process the original dataset files in different ways, it is common that the statistics do not agree with each other in literature.*

The average degree $\bar{d}$ is defined as $\bar{d}=|V|/|E|$ (for directed graphs) and $\bar{d}=2|V|/|E|$ (for undirected graphs), where $|V|$ is the number of vertices and $|E|$ is the number of edges.

<small>*The table is sorted by $|E|$ in the ascending order.</small>

### Synthetic Graphs

The synthetic graphs are mainly used to evaluate performance of distributed subgraph matching methods on big graphs. The widely-used synthetic graph generation models or generator are summarized below.

#### R-MAT Model

The R-MAT model [21] uses a recursive model to generate the adjacency matrix of a random graph. The R-MAT model can generate different kinds of random graphs, including E-R models and power-law graphs. The R-MAT model is used in [Graph500 Benchmark](https://graph500.org/?page_id=12) to generate very big graphs.

There are some typical implementation of RMAT random graph generators:
1. [TrillionG (SIGMOD17)](https://github.com/chan150/TrillionG);
2. [Graph500 Kronecker Generator (Reference Implementation)](https://graph500.org/?page_id=47).

#### Waterloo SPARQL Diversity Test Suite (WatDiv)

WatDiv [22] is a benchmark developed for RDF data managements systems. WatDiv can generate large RDF datasets with a wide spectrum of SPARQL queries. WatDiv has a data generator and a query generator. The description of WatDiv is available at [its home page](https://dsg.uwaterloo.ca/watdiv/).

WatDiv also has [a stream version](https://dsg.uwaterloo.ca/watdiv/stream-watdiv) to generate dynamic RDF graphs.

#### Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM)

LUBM is a benchmark for RDF data management systems.
It follows a university domain ontology to generate big RDF graphs.
It includes a data generator and a suite of test queries.
The homepage of LUBM is http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/.

#### LDBC Social Network Benchmarking (LDBC-SNB)

LDBC Social Network Benchmarking (LDBC-SNB) is a benchmark suite for graph databases.
It can simulate both interactive workloads and business intelligence workloads of a social network.
It includes a social network generator that generates complex property graphs and a set of benchmark queries.
The home page of LDBC-SNB is https://ldbcouncil.org/benchmarks/snb/.

#### EvoGraph

EvoGraph [23] is a tool upscaling a given real-world graph to generate large simulated graphs. The generated simulated graphs can preserve the properties of the underlying real-world graph. The source code of EvoGraph is available at [chan150's GitHub repository](https://github.com/chan150/EvoGraph).
